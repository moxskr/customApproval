# Functional Requirements

## Approval Flows Based on Opportunity Stage and Amount:

There should be three distinct approval flows, based on the combination of the Opportunity Stage and the Opportunity Amount:
 - Standard Approval Flow: This flow triggers when the Opportunity Stage is "Qualification" or "Needs Analysis" and the Opportunity Amount is less than $50,000. It requires approval from the Sales Manager only.
 - Intermediate Approval Flow: This flow triggers when the Opportunity Stage is "Proposal" or "Negotiation" and the Opportunity Amount is between $50,000 and $250,000. This flow requires approvals from:
    - The Sales Manager
    - The Finance Manager
- Complex Approval Flow: This flow triggers when the Opportunity Stage is "Closed - Won" and the Opportunity Amount is      greater than $250,000. This flow requires approvals from:
    - The Sales Manager
    - The Finance Manager
    - The Vice President of Sales
    - Legal Department (based on specific conditions like discounts or contract terms)

## Delegation and Reassignment:

Approvers should have the option to delegate the approval to another user with the same or higher level of authority.
If an approver is unavailable for more than 48 hours, the approval request should be automatically reassigned to their direct manager.
Conditional Rules for Approval Flow:

If the Opportunity has a discount of more than 15%, it should trigger an additional review step by the Pricing Team, regardless of the approval flow.
If the Opportunity is associated with a strategic account (determined by a custom field Strategic_Account__c), the flow should include the CEO's approval.
Parallel Approval Processes:

For the Complex Approval Flow, approvals from the Sales Manager and Finance Manager should be done in parallel to speed up the process.
The approval request should move to the next step only if both parties approve. If either one rejects, the process stops and the Opportunity stage should be updated to "Approval Rejected".
Automatic Notifications:

Send email and Salesforce notification to the initiator of the approval request whenever an approver takes an action (approved/rejected/delegated).
If an approval request is pending for more than 24 hours, send a reminder notification to the approver.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Scalability:

The solution should be designed in such a way that new approval conditions and flows can be added or modified with minimal changes to the existing codebase.
It should be able to handle a high volume of approval requests without performance degradation.

## Security:

Implement appropriate sharing and field-level security to ensure that only authorized users can view or approve the records.
Audit log functionality should be available to track changes in the approval status and keep records of each action.

## Code Quality and Best Practices:

Use Apex triggers, classes, and custom settings to create a modular and maintainable solution.
Follow best practices like bulkification, error handling, and governor limits management to ensure the solution performs efficiently even under heavy loads.
Write unit tests to cover at least 85% of the code, including positive, negative, and edge cases, ensuring that they adhere to Salesforce testing best practices.

## Integration with Other Systems:

Implement logic to send approval data to an external system through a REST API when the Opportunity amount is greater than $500,000. This should happen only after all internal approvals are completed.
Handle cases where the external system is down, with retry logic and error handling to manage failures gracefully.

## User Experience:

Provide a visual representation of the current approval process in the Opportunity record page (e.g., a Lightning component showing the approval path and status).
Allow users to easily track the status of their approval requests, including information on who the pending approvers are.

# Additional Requirements

## Documentation:

Include detailed documentation on how the approval processes work, how to configure them, and how to add new approval flows.
Document the Apex classes, triggers, and any integration points for easy maintenance.

## Governance and Compliance:

Ensure that the solution adheres to data privacy and compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR) by implementing appropriate data handling mechanisms.
Log any changes to approval data in a way that can be reviewed for compliance audits.
This test task should give you a comprehensive experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining a custom approval process in Salesforce, along with ensuring it meets both business needs and technical standards.
